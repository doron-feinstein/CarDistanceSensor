A small project to help me park my old car
My driveway is tight which makes it challenging to park my old car as close as possible to the end of the driveway.
The car has no distance sensors on the front, so I want to mount a homebrew distance indicator at the end of the driveway.
As the car gets closer to the end of the driveway, the distance indicator will light LED's to indicate the distance. 

To get things started I am building a prototype on a breadboard.

Prototype parts:
1. ATMega328P microcontroller to run the show
2. HC-SR04 ultrasonic range sensor (to be replaced with a waterproof sensor)
3. TMP36 for temperature compensation
4. LED's to indicate the distance
